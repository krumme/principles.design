principles:
- principle: General Principles
  > Services will be designed against an understanding of PURPOSE, demand and the current capability of the organisation to deliver the service
  > Services will be designed ‘outside-in’ (customer focused), ‘not in-side out’ (internally focused)
  > Services will be designed within the context of the system, not in isolation, e.g. by focusing on the optimisation of the system as a whole, rather than on individual components
  > Services will be designed around an understanding of value and efficiency of flow
  > The design will not treat a special cause of variation as if it was a common cause
  > Services will be co-created with their users
  > Service designs will be prototyped
  > Against a clear business model and high level design, services will be designed, built and deployed incrementally and iteratively, to deliver value early and to inform the design
  > Services will be designed and delivered collaboratively, leveraging maximum benefit from the internal and partner network
